## Description

_This web applicaation uses looping and arrays to return a message in which all numbers that include the digit 3 are replaced by "Won't you be my neighbor?", all numbers with digit 2 are replaced with the word "Boop!", all numbers with digit 3 are replaced with the word "Beep!", and all numbers that are divisible by 3 are replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor, " followed by the user's name. If you enter the current year (2020), you will be greeted with a dance party that uses the Audio element of HTML 5._
